About
=====================


The **EDE** (Electric Digital E-logger) is a telluric recording system that has been developed by the Institut für Geophysik, University of Münster in order to measure variations of the Earth's electric field, for applications in Magnetotellurics (MT) and Controlled Source Audio Magnetotellurics (CSAMT).

Objective
--------------------
Electromagnetic surveying in controlled and natural source applications can benefit from dense arrays of electric field recordings combined with more sparsely distributed five-component (electric and magnetic) stations. To facilitate such a surveying strategy, we have built a low-cost, low-power and easy-to-setup two-component data logger.

Product Description
----------------------------
The **EDE** (Electric Digital E-logger) is a telluric recording system that has been developed to measure variations of the Earth's electric field, for applications in Magnetotellurics (MT) and Controlled Source Audio Magnetotellurics (CSAMT).

The **EDE** is used to record two channels (Ex and Ey) simultaneity with wide variety of sampling frequencies, ranges from 64 Hz to 1024 Hz in the LF (Low Frequency) system and from 256 Hz to 4096 Hz in the HF (High Frequency) systems.

The **EDE** raw data is stored in a SSD drive attached to the unit and can only be accessed by removing the SSD from the unit and connect it to an external PC.

The **EDE** has a hard-wired gain of 10 that can't be switched off.

Each EDE unit can be operated in two modes:

1. Automatic mode, where the user prepares an ASCII job list file with the sequential jobs parameters (:ref:`EDE Job list Editor <joblist_editor>` can be used for an interactive job list design).

2. Manual mode, where the user choose the recording parameters for one continuous job.
